# Unity Drone Projects

This folder contains **Unity-based drone simulation experiments** developed as part of the SkySpec project.
The goal of these projects is to explore Unity as a simulation platform for drone visualization, interaction, and sensor-level experimentation, and to compare it with other simulation tools such as NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Projects Overview

### 1. 3Ddrone

This project focuses on a **basic 3D drone simulation**, including the drone model, environment setup, and basic interaction within Unity.
It serves as an initial prototype for visualizing drone behavior and testing scene configurations.

### 2. sensor

This project explores **sensor-related simulations** in Unity, focusing on how sensor data can be represented and tested within a virtual environment.
It is intended as an early-stage experiment for understanding sensor integration and visualization in Unity-based drone simulations.
